# UUID arguments

The UUID argument is used to uniquely identify players, entities and attribute modifiers. As a result, its cast type is Java's `UUID`.

<div class="warning">

**Note:**

The UUIDArgument is only compatible with Minecraft version 1.16 and above, since that is the version this argument was introduced. Attempting to use the UUID argument on a version lower than Minecraft 1.16 will throw a `UUIDArgumentException`.
