# Afterword

> **Developer's Note:**
>
> Congratulations on making it to the end of the documentation! I hope it was easy to understand everything ... I feel like it's a bit content heavy.
>
> This project is by far my most worked on and probably the project I'm most proud of. You can read about the creation of the CommandAPI in my blog post [here](https://www.jorelsblog.co.uk/Creating-the-CommandAPI/).
>
> I'd like to give credit to all of the people that have opened issues on GitHub, that have truly made it what it is now. In particular, I'd like to thank:
> - **Combustible**, who was my #1 supporter and motivated me to keep this project alive after its release.
>
> - **DerpNerb**, who gave me the idea to convert the CommandAPI to a Maven project which resulted in making the CommandAPI much more accessible for everyone.
> - **Draycia**, who suggested that I put `CommandSender` objects inside `DynamicSuggestedStringArguments`, which allow dynamic arguments to be much more powerful.
> - **HielkeMinecraft**, who suggested various improvements for the `LocationArgument` class; suggested adding results and successes for commands and being a great bug reporter in general.
> - **i509VCB**, who is an absolute genius and a really good bug spotter. They pointed out a severe bug that made libraries depending on the CommandAPI depend on Brigadier; created the documentation for using the CommandAPI with Gradle and suggested using the NBTAPI to include NBT support.
> - **Minenash**, who was the driving force for the 3.0 release, which adds a plethora of additional arguments, and continued to research, write documentation examples, bug test, code review and basically peer program its development through the whole progress. All from the comfort of GitHub's issues page.
> - **Tinkot**, who gave a review of the CommandAPI on its spigot page. This motivated me to fix a 6 month old bug. Somehow.
>
> I never really expected more than 5 or so people to use this API, so it was truly an exciting time creating this for everyone - seeing everyone's responses, issues and problems helped me keep going.
>
> In short, thank you, and everyone else that helped make the CommandAPI what it is.
