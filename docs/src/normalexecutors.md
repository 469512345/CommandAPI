# Normal command executors

Command executors are of the following format, where `sender` is a [`CommandSender`](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/command/CommandSender.html), and `args` is an `Object[]`, which represents arguments which are parsed by the CommandAPI.

```java
new CommandAPICommand("...").executes((sender, args) -> {
  //Code here  
});
```

With normal command executors, these do not need to return anything. By default, this will return a _success value_ of 1 if it runs successfully, and a _success value_ of 0 if it runs unsuccessfully, either by throwing an exception _(RuntimeException)_ or by forcing the command to fail.
