# Command executors

The CommandAPI provides two separate command executors which are lambdas which execute the code you want when a command is called. These are the classes `CommandExecutor`, which just runs the contents of a command, and `ResultingCommandExecutor` that returns an integral _(whole number)_ result.

## Resulting Command Executors

The resulting command executor takes advantage of Minecraft's command implementation to return results which can be used for future commands. This result can be used with the `/execute store result ...` command
